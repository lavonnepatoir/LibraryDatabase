This Library Management System (LMS) is a simple Java-based application designed to manage a collection of books. My recent updates now allow it to take user input and execute library actions as necessary.

The LMS allows users to:

Add Books: Add new books to the library either manually or by importing from a text file.

Remove/Checkout Books: Remove books from the collection using its unique book ID.

List All Books: Display a list of all books currently available in the library.




The project is structured with three main classes:

Book: Represents individual books with attributes like title, author, and book ID.

Library: Manages the collection of books and provides methods to add, remove, and list them.

Main: The entry point of the program where the library operations are executed.
